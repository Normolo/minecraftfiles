# Versioning
You will be ask to version your commits and pulls for maximum organization. This is how to version:
#### Versioning Server Enhancements
Find the latest tag for example: v2.8, then, from the [changelog page](https://github.com/Normolo/unnamedsmp/wiki/changelog), find the latest release, example: v2.8f. Your submission should then be v2.8g. **Remember to always branch off from the latest branch** If your submission is accepted and has alot of new content, it may also be classed as v2.9. Please note that only server enhancements are given the letter after the tag number, though server bugfixes are included in tag releases.
#### Versioning Discord Enhancements
Search for the latest `dt` branch, example: `dt-42`. Change what you seek to change after branching off your branch `dt-43` from latest and then pull request
#### Versioning bugfixes from issues
Name your branch/pull: `bugfix-<issue number>`
##### Versioning bugfixes that don't have issues
Create an issue with, then name your branch/pull: `bugix-<issue number>`
#### Versioning updates to .github material
Create a branch with the title: `gitupdate-<number>`
