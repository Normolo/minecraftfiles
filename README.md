## Server Description
Tired of large, pay-to-win servers that dont care about the average player? Want a small, laid-back community to play with? Then consider our Unnamed SMP. We have some quality of life plugins that include dynmap and some other anti-grief ones. The server is never offline, that means you can play whenever you like. We don't have alot of members that play regularly, and we're looking to change it. Apart from this, our owner is a dedicated and experienced java programmer that codes our own plugins! We don't require you to go trough tedious whitelist applications, just join our discord, get the ip and start playing!

## What's the purpose of the repositry
Simple: Integrity. We have had several of our members complain that certain members of staff were abusing their power. After an investigation into this by the Founder, it was deduced, that altough greatly exxegerated, these claims were somewhat true. In response to this, a repositry was made to help keep the server's history clean and also inspire aspiring server-owners to use our files. Key word: 'inspire'. You are not to share the following information with any other user and you may not use it for your own purposes unless you have written consent from the founder.

##### Sever is dying, what now?
This repositry will continue to function as a base-line for all server owners who seek to use our configuration options
