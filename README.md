## What's the purpose of the repositry
Simple: Integrity. We have had several of our members complain that certain members of staff were abusing their power. After an investigation into this by the Founder, it was deduced, that altough greatly exxegerated, these claims were somewhat true. In response to this, a repositry was made to help keep the server's history clean and also inspire aspiring server-owners to use our files. Key word: 'inspire'. You are not to share the following information with any other user and you may not use it for your own purposes unless you have written consent from the founder.
